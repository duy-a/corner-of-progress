- I have used VUe in the past
- Vue has not SSR, so I use Nuxt which is easy to install and use and it proved SSR out of the box
- Rich ecosystem
- However, I will use Nuxt for its nuxt generate ability to host staticaly

- For the styling of the blog i use tailwindcss. I tried once in the past, but it never sticked.
- Learning curve is a bit steep so took a while to wrap the head around.
- Designing the webpage was never my strong side, so it took quite of experimenting.
  - Designing with tailwind at first was very slow, it felt like writing inline css.
  - however, by the end of the day, it clicked and suddenly and prototyping was quite fast
  - Tailwind did help a lot with prototyping

- other modules are used are nuxt/content
  - First thoughts was to use some headless api, but after the research to use nuxt/content

- hosting is done on netlify
- domain bought on google domains
