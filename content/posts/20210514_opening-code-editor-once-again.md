## Motivation

I didn't do any serious software development related projects since a career change. Considering how fast the technology progresses, my knowledge is outdated and my skills are rusty. I don't want to lose the touch completely. So I decided to, once again, open a long-forgotten code editor on my laptop and start a project to refresh my knowledge & polish my coding skills, and along the way share & document progress.

## Projects to work on

Before deciding on a project, I must consider few things below:

- I have a full-time job
- I am a family man with a year old boy
- Scope of the project must be achievable by a single person
- Complex enough to keep me engaged & motivated long term
- The finished project must be useful in my daily life

### Small Project

For the small project, it is quite simple, create my own blog without using any site builders. Will act as a gateway re-enter the software development scene.

### Big Project

A main project will be "**Goal Diary**" (actual name in progress). It is a task management application with a big focus on helping in organizing and planning daily tasks and make sure they are aligned with achieving a long term goal. And by the end of achieving a goal, progress can be looked at and visualized, just like a diary, day by day.

In a nutshell, it is a todo app with a heavily opinionated system.

Of course, it is just one idea out of many for the main project, however based on rough assessment, it ticks all the checkboxes. It is also the idea which excites me the most, as I need this kind of app in my daily life and it is a todo app I see myself sticking to long term.

## Course is set

The projects have been selected and all that is left is to actually start the projects. For the next step is do define projects in more details, but that's for another entry(s).

I will end this entry with a promise to myself: "Post an update on the progress at least once a week".
