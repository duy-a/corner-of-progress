## Motivation

I didn't do any serious software development related projects since a career change. Considering how fast the technology progresses and new exciting things getting announced every day, I suddenly had an urge to refresh my knowledge & polish my coding skills, and share & document progress. And thus opening a code editor once again.

## Projects to work on

Before deciding on a project, I must consider few things below:

- I have a full-time job
- I am a family man with a year old boy
- Scope of the project must be achievable by a single person
- Complex enough to keep me engaged & motivated long term
- The finished project must be useful in my daily life

## Small Project

For the small project, it is quite simple, create my blog without using any site builders. It will act as a gateway to re-enter the software development scene.

## Big Project

For the main project, it will be "**Goal Diary**" (actual name in progress or not). It is a todo app with a big focus on helping in organizing and planning daily tasks, however making sure the tasks are aligned with achieving a long term goal. And by the end of achieving a goal, progress can be looked at and visualized, just like a diary, day by day.

In a nutshell, it is a todo app with a heavily opinionated system.

Of course, it is just one idea out of many for the main project, however, based on rough assessment, it ticks all the checkboxes. It is also the idea that excites me the most, as I need this kind of app in my daily life and it is a todo app I see myself sticking to long term.

## Course is set

The projects have been selected and all that is left is to start them. I will end this entry with a promise to myself:

"Post an update on the progress at least once a week".
