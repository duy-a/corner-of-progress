This week decided to learn blender with a famous [doughnut tutorial](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TPrnSACiTJ4&list=PLexwJr_iILK7IkuhEeAYeN7aLV5AAXKa-&ab_channel=BlenderGuru)

The tutorial is simply amazing, as it is not just "click what I click", but a teacher explains the whys in great detail.

I can finally say that I have joined a doughnut club. Here is a result, not perfect but I am happy.

After completing the tutorial I have a much better appreciation for 3D artists.
